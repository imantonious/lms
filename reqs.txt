For library management, this project considers six departments â€“ Computer, Electrical, Civil, Electronics, Mechanical, and Architecture. These departments work simultaneously with the operations mentioned above. 

Create books in 6 sections of departments and build a shelf of 3 to 5 books. You may use arrays or vectors.
Create a class hierarchy. Dept has many books. 
Department of books would come from a file.  Computer.txt, Electrical.txt, etc. 
Establish basic fields members needed for a book
Create a module to have user selects a department based in a menu and can search for a book in that department to check out
Allow the User to check out the books selected in the cart.
You can add a book to the Civil section, delete a book from the Electrical section or view issued book details of the Mechanical department.
Print final checkout receipt as output to screen
